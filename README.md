# Time Series Analysis 
In this project, we will do Time series analysis on Air passengers data manually instead of using ARIMA algorithm. So we will build our own algorithm. For that, we need to understand time series analysis formulation

The dataset is available for free from the DataMarket webpage as a csv download with the filename “international-airline-passengers.csv“. https://datamarket.com/data/set/22u3/international-airline-passengers-monthly-totals-in-thousands-jan-49-dec-60#!ds=22u3&display=line
